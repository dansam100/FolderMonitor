FolderMonitor
=============

A folder monitoring and backup system

A family friend had problems backing up files back in the days in 2007.
Rather than use some of the commercial software out there, I decided to write a program that monitors folders and backs as a fun side project.
I did not get to finish since I still had school and the main purpose was to learn.
